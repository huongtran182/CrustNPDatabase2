Welcome to CNPD: The Crustacean Neuropeptide Database

Neuropeptides are critical signaling molecules involved in numerous physiological processes, including metabolism, reproduction, development, and behavior. In crustaceans, neuropeptides regulate key biological functions such as molting, feeding, and immune responses. Despite their significance, crustacean neuropeptides remain underrepresented in existing peptide databases.

To address this gap, we introduce the Crustacean Neuropeptide Database (CNPD) â€” A comprehensive resource for neuropeptide research in crustacean species. CNPD systematically curates experimentally confirmed neuropeptides, providing detailed annotations to support comparative neurobiology, functional studies, and computational peptide discovery.
